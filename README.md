## Summary of Tech Stack
This appication was built using the lastest technology and design patterns of today era (2020). I chose to built this application using purely HTML,CSS, and Javascript. Using HTML ,CSS, and Javascript, I can quickly structure my code fast and easy giving layouts a smooth sleek responsive design.

For CSS, I decided to go with SASS (Syntactically awesome style sheets) , because of it's amazing features. Using Sass, I can apply styles to my layouts faster than normal css. This framework also offers feature like nesting, allowing me to manipulate element easier than the standard css. This will result in better structure and minimizing time to complete the task. Thinking with a team mindset, this will be great for any future developer that may potential join in this project.
